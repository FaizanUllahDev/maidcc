# **Maidcc**


Maidcc is a new Flutter project that provides a platform for users to connect with and hire maids for cleaning services.

But my task was to built Task Management App


# **Getting Started**

To get started with Maidcc, you will need to:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio or Visual Studio Code.
3. Install the Flutter SDK [3.19.2] and Dart plugin (if you haven't already).
4. Run flutter pub get to install the project dependencies.
5. Connect an Android or iOS device or emulator to your computer.
6. Click on the Run button in Android Studio or Visual Studio Code to build and install the app on your device or emulator.

# **Usage**

Once the app is installed, you can open it and start using it. The app allows users to:

*  Log in from this given doc users. Like  [username : atuny0 password : 9uQFF1Lh]
*  Add/update/delete the todos. 


# **Challenges**

The Maidcc project faces a number of challenges, including:

* API Update/Delete/Add not working: The current implementation of the API does not support updating, deleting, or adding new maids. This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed in order for the app to be fully functional.
* Design: The app's design is currently basic and unpolished. A more user-friendly and visually appealing design would improve the overall user experience.
* Features: The app currently lacks a number of features that would make it more useful for users, such as the ability to filter maids by price, availability, and rating.
* Documentation: The app's documentation is currently lacking. This makes it difficult for developers to understand how to use the app and contribute to the project.
